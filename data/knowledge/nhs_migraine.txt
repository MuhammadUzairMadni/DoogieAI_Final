**Migraine (Simple Summary)**
A migraine is a strong headache, often throbbing on one side of the head, sometimes with warning signs like flashing lights or numbness.
Common symptoms include tiredness, food cravings, mood changes, dizziness, and vision problems.
Treatment includes painkillers, triptans, anti-sickness medicines, and lifestyle changes like eating regularly and avoiding triggers.
See a GP if migraines are frequent, severe, or hard to control.
