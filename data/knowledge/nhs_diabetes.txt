Diabetes is when your blood sugar level stays too high because your body doesn’t make or use insulin properly.
Main symptoms include feeling very thirsty, peeing often, tiredness, and losing weight without trying.
Type 1 needs lifelong insulin; Type 2 and gestational diabetes can often be managed or prevented with healthy eating, exercise, and medicines like metformin.
See a doctor urgently if you or your child have symptoms; get checked if you’re at high risk.
Controlling blood sugar helps prevent long-term problems like heart disease, kidney damage, and vision issues.
