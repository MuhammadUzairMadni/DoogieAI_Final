CHD happens when fatty deposits block the heart’s blood vessels, reducing blood flow.
Main symptoms include chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, and pain in the neck, jaw, or arms.
It’s caused by lifestyle factors like smoking, unhealthy diet, or conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes.
Treatment includes lifestyle changes, medicines, and sometimes surgery or angioplasty to open arteries.
See a doctor if you have chest pain, breathing problems, or feel faint, especially during activity.
