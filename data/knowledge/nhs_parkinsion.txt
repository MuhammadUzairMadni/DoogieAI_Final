Parkinson’s disease (Simple Summary):
Parkinson’s disease is a brain condition that slowly damages nerve cells, affecting body movement. Its main symptoms are shaking (tremor), slow movement, and stiff muscles, often with mood, balance, or sleep problems. It happens when the brain makes less dopamine, usually affecting people over 50. There’s no cure, but medicines, physiotherapy, and sometimes surgery can help control symptoms. See a doctor if you notice shaking, stiffness, or slow movement that doesn’t improve.
