Pyelonephritis â€“ Summary (Oxford Style)

Definition:
Acute pyelonephritis is a bacterial infection of the renal pelvis and parenchyma, most often due to ascending infection from the bladder. Common pathogens include E. coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, and Enterococcus species.

Key symptoms/signs:
Rapid onset of fever, rigors, flank or loin pain, nausea, vomiting, and malaise. Often associated with dysuria, frequency, or suprapubic discomfort. On examination, there is costovertebral angle tenderness and the patient appears systemically unwell.

Diagnosis:
Confirmed by urinalysis (leucocytes, nitrites, blood) and urine culture. Raised WBC count and CRP are typical; imaging (ultrasound or CT) is indicated if obstruction or poor response to therapy is suspected.

Management principles:
Prompt empirical antibiotics (e.g. ciprofloxacin or co-amoxiclav) adjusted to culture results. Ensure adequate hydration, analgesia, and monitoring for sepsis. Admit if pregnant, systemically unwell, or unable to tolerate oral therapy. Drain abscesses or relieve obstruction if present. Recurrent infections warrant investigation for structural abnormalities or reflux.
