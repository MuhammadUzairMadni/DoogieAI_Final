**Heart Failure (Simple Summary):**
Heart failure means your heart is too weak or stiff to pump blood properly. Common symptoms include shortness of breath, tiredness, swollen legs, and feeling dizzy or faint. It can’t usually be cured but can be managed with medicines, lifestyle changes, and sometimes surgery or implanted devices. See a doctor if symptoms persist or worsen, and call emergency services if they appear suddenly or severely. It’s more common in older adults and can get worse over time.
