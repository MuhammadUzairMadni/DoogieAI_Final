**Osteoarthritis (NHS Summary â€“ Simple English, 5 lines)**
Osteoarthritis is a common joint condition where the protective cartilage wears down, causing pain and stiffness, mostly in the knees, hips, or hands.
Main symptoms include joint pain, stiffness, swelling, and a cracking sound when moving.
It cannot be cured but can be managed with exercise, weight control, painkillers, physiotherapy, or sometimes surgery.
You should see a doctor if joint pain or stiffness lasts long or makes daily activities difficult.
Staying active, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding joint injuries can help lower your risk.
