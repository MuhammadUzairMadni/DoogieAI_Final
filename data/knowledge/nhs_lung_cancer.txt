**Lung Cancer (NHS Summary – Simple English)**
Lung cancer is a serious disease where cells in the lungs grow uncontrollably.
Main symptoms include a long-lasting cough, coughing blood, breathlessness, tiredness, weight loss, and chest pain.
Treatment depends on the type and stage — surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or targeted medicines may be used.
It mostly affects older adults, especially smokers, though non-smokers can get it too.
See a doctor if you have a cough that won’t go away or any of the above symptoms.
