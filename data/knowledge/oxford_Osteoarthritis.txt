Osteoarthritis (OA)
Osteoarthritis is a chronic degenerative joint disorder characterized by progressive loss of articular cartilage, subchondral bone remodeling, and variable synovial inflammation, leading to joint pain and functional limitation. It most commonly affects the knees, hips, and small hand joints.

Key symptoms/signs:
Activity-related joint pain, brief morning stiffness (<30 min), crepitus, bony swelling (Heberden’s/Bouchard’s nodes), reduced range of motion, and periarticular tenderness. Systemic features are absent.

Diagnosis:
Primarily clinical—age ≥45 years, activity-related pain, and short-lived stiffness; imaging is reserved for diagnostic uncertainty.

Management principles:
Core measures include patient education, weight reduction, and exercise to improve strength and function. Analgesia begins with paracetamol or topical NSAIDs; oral NSAIDs may be used cautiously. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections provide short-term relief. Surgical referral is considered for severe, refractory symptoms with major functional impairment.
