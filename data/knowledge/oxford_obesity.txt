Obesity – Summary (Oxford Handbook Style)

Definition:
Obesity is a chronic, relapsing disease characterised by excessive accumulation of body fat that impairs health. It is defined by a BMI ≥30 kg/m² (≥27.5 kg/m² in South Asian and Black ethnic groups) or raised waist-to-height ratio (>0.5).

Key symptoms/signs:
Progressive weight gain, central adiposity, breathlessness, fatigue, joint pain, and sleep disturbance. Associated comorbidities include type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea, osteoarthritis, and cardiovascular disease.

Diagnosis:
Based on BMI and waist circumference or waist-to-height ratio. Assess for metabolic, endocrine, and cardiovascular comorbidities with HbA1c, lipid profile, and thyroid function tests.

Management principles:
Long-term, multidisciplinary approach. Begin with lifestyle modification—calorie-controlled diet, regular physical activity, and behavioural therapy. Pharmacotherapy (e.g. orlistat, GLP-1 agonists) may support weight loss where indicated. Bariatric surgery is considered for BMI ≥ 40 kg/m² or ≥ 35 kg/m² with significant comorbidity. Continuous follow-up is essential to prevent relapse and support sustained behaviour change.
