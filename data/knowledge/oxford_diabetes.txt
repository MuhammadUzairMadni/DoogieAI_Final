Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM)

Definition:
GDM is glucose intolerance of variable severity first recognized during pregnancy, usually resolving after delivery. It results from increased insulin resistance and inadequate compensatory insulin secretion.

Key Symptoms/Signs:
Typically asymptomatic; may present with excessive fetal growth (macrosomia) or polyhydramnios. Risk factors include obesity, advanced maternal age, prior macrosomic baby, family history of diabetes, and high-risk ethnicity.

Diagnosis:
By 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 24–28 weeks:
• Fasting plasma glucose ≥5.6 mmol/L, or
• 2-hour plasma glucose ≥7.8 mmol/L (NICE criteria).

Management Principles:
• Begin with diet modification, weight control, and daily glucose monitoring.
• Add metformin if targets unmet; insulin if hyperglycaemia persists or metformin contraindicated.
• Target glucose: fasting <5.3 mmol/L, 1-hr post-meal <7.8 mmol/L.
• Regular fetal growth scans from 28 weeks; deliver by 40+6 weeks or earlier if complications.
• Postpartum: reassess glucose tolerance and counsel regarding future type 2 diabetes risk.
