**Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) – Simple Summary**
Chronic kidney disease is a long-term condition where the kidneys don’t work properly, often caused by diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol.
Early stages usually have no symptoms, but later signs can include tiredness, swelling in feet or hands, shortness of breath, feeling sick, or blood in urine.
There’s no cure, but treatment includes healthy lifestyle changes, medicines, dialysis, or kidney transplant to manage symptoms and slow progress.
See a doctor if you notice persistent swelling, tiredness, or changes in urine.
Regular check-ups and controlling related conditions can help prevent worsening.
