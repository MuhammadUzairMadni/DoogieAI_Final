Breast cancer is when cells in the breast grow abnormally and form a lump or swelling.
Common symptoms include a lump, changes in breast shape or skin, nipple discharge, or pain that doesnâ€™t go away.
Treatment usually involves surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, or targeted medicines.
You should see a doctor if you notice any breast changes or persistent pain.
Early detection through breast screening (mammogram) greatly improves the chances of successful treatment.
