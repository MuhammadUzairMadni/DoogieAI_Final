Depression (Simple Summary – NHS)
Depression is a serious mental health condition that causes long-lasting sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest in things you once enjoyed.
Common symptoms include low mood, tiredness, poor sleep, appetite changes, and sometimes thoughts of self-harm.
It can be triggered by stressful life events, health problems, or happen without a clear reason.
Treatment includes lifestyle changes, talking therapies (like CBT), and antidepressant medicines for more severe cases.
See a GP if you feel low or hopeless most days for more than 2 weeks — early help can lead to full recovery.
