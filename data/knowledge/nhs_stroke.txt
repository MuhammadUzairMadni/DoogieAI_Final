A **stroke** happens when blood flow to part of the brain is blocked or a blood vessel bursts.
Main signs appear suddenly — **face drooping, arm weakness, and slurred speech** — remember **FAST** (Face, Arms, Speech, Time to call 999).
Other symptoms include **blurred vision, confusion, dizziness, severe headache, or vomiting**.
Treatment depends on the type — doctors use scans and tests to decide whether it’s caused by a **clot or bleeding**.
**Get help immediately**, even if symptoms go away; quick treatment saves lives and reduces long-term damage.
