**Obesity (NHS Summary in Simple English)**
Obesity means having too much body fat, usually measured by BMI (30 or above). It can cause tiredness, breathlessness, joint pain, low confidence, and increase the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers. Itâ€™s mainly caused by eating more calories than used, low activity, genetics, or certain medicines. Treatment includes a healthy low-calorie diet, regular exercise, support programs, or medicines like orlistat; surgery may help in severe cases. See a doctor if your BMI is 30+ or if weight problems are affecting your health or daily life.
