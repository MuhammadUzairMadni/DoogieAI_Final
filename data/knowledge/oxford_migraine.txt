Migraine – Summary (Oxford Handbook Style)

Definition:
Migraine is a common, primary episodic headache disorder characterised by recurrent attacks of moderate to severe headache, often unilateral and pulsating, associated with sensory disturbances. It may be episodic (<15 days/month) or chronic (≥15 days/month for >3 months with ≥8 migrainous days).

Key Symptoms/Signs:
Headache lasting 4–72 hours, typically unilateral, throbbing, aggravated by activity, and accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia. About one-third experience transient focal neurological symptoms (aura) preceding headache.

Diagnosis:
Clinical, based on characteristic history and exclusion of secondary causes. Neuroimaging is reserved for atypical or complicated presentations.

Management Principles:
Identify and avoid trigger factors (e.g. stress, sleep disturbance, diet). Treat acute attacks early with NSAIDs, triptans, and antiemetics. Consider prophylaxis (e.g. propranolol, amitriptyline, topiramate) if frequent or disabling. Encourage headache diary and lifestyle modification.

Prognosis:
Tends to improve with age; attacks often lessen after menopause or during late pregnancy.
