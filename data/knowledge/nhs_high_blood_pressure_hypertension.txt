**High Blood Pressure (Hypertension) – Summary:**
High blood pressure means the force of blood against your arteries is too strong, which can cause heart attacks or strokes. It usually has no symptoms, but sometimes causes headaches, chest pain, or blurred vision. You can manage it through a healthy diet, regular exercise, less salt and alcohol, and medicines prescribed by your doctor. Get your blood pressure checked regularly, especially if you’re over 40 or at risk. Call **999** if you have sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, or pain spreading to your arm, neck, or jaw.
