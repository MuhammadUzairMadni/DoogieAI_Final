**Asthma (NHS Summary – Simple English)**
Asthma is a long-term condition that makes it hard to breathe because your airways become swollen.
Symptoms include wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness, which can get worse at night or after triggers like cold air, smoke, or pollen.
Treatment mainly involves using inhalers daily or when symptoms appear; some people may need tablets or injections.
See a GP if symptoms don’t improve, you use your inhaler more often, or asthma affects your sleep or activities.
Call **999** if breathing becomes very difficult or an inhaler doesn’t help during an asthma attack.
