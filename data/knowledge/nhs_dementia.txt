**Dementia (Simple NHS Summary)**
Dementia is a brain condition that causes problems with memory, thinking, language, mood, and daily activities. It’s not a normal part of ageing and includes types like Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia. Symptoms include forgetfulness, confusion, mood changes, and trouble with communication or decisions. There’s no cure, but medicines (like Donepezil or Memantine) and therapies can help manage symptoms. See a doctor if memory loss affects your daily life or worries you or your family.
